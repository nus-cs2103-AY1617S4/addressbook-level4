# Test Script for Manual Testing

## Loading WhatsNext with sample data

Ensure that you have the file `SampleData.xml` inside the `/src/test/data/ManualTesting` folder.
Open the SampleData.xml file and copy the contents into the whatsnext.xml file in the `/data folder`.

If the whatsnext.xml file does not exist, create a new xml file with the file name `whatsnext` and
copy the content from SampleData.xml over.

Run the MainApp.java file as a Java application. This will prompt the application to run and the WhatsNext
UI will appear.

If the sample data will copied over correctly, the task manager will have a total of 50 tasks inside. <br>
Index 1 - 14 will be in the Events column. <br>
Index 15 - 38 will be in the Deadlines column. <br>
Index 39 - 51 will be in the Basic Task column.
